# Project Overview

This project implements a **distributed shared memory system** where multiple nodes can access and manipulate shared memory locations through a centralized directory service. The system demonstrates memory coherence mechanisms and data consistency protocols in distributed computing environments.

## Requirements

- **Omnet++** (version 5.x or later)  
  Simulation framework for discrete event systems.

- **C++ Compiler**  
  Compatible with Omnet++ (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

- **Qt (optional)**  
  For graphical user interface support in Omnet++.

- **Make**  
  For building the project using the provided Makefile.

- **Operating System**  
  Windows, Linux, or macOS (tested on Windows).

- **Dependencies**  
  All required message files (`*.msg`) must be compiled before running the simulation.

- **IDE (optional)**  
  Visual Studio Code or any C++/Omnet++ compatible IDE for development.
